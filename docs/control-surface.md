# Shade: what a test harness can drive

Everything here comes from reading the source of `shade/` (with the lab patches) and from runs in
`runs.noindex/`. Paths are relative to `shade/`.

## Launch

    env TMPDIR=<lab>/tmp.noindex VK_ICD_FILENAMES=<lab>/deps/build-swiftshader/Darwin/vk_swiftshader_icd.json \
      shade/build/shade boot --rootfs <run>/rootfs --device iPhone3,1 --host-cache <cache> \
        --display headless --gles-backend software --control-stdin --frame-output <run>/frame.png

* `--device`: iPhone1,1 iPhone1,2 iPhone2,1 iPhone3,1 iPhone4,1 iPod1,1 iPod2,1 iPod4,1 (lab patch)
  iPad1,1 iPad2,1 (`src/foundation/device_model.cpp`).
* The release comes from `System/Library/CoreServices/SystemVersion.plist`; `9A*`, `9B*` map to
  darwin11, every `10*` build to darwin13 (`src/device_state/darwin_kernel_configuration.cpp`).
  An unknown build refuses to boot.
* The guest writes straight into `--rootfs`; there is no overlay. Shade also creates
  `dirname(rootfs)/runtime/shm/` and `dirname(rootfs)/.shade-device-state/` (key store). So every
  run gets its own directory holding an APFS clone (`cp -c -R`) and nothing else.
* `--activation activated` (default) rewrites `private/var/root/Library/Lockdown/data_ark.plist`
  and hooks liblockdown's activation queries; it does not touch Setup Assistant.
* `--network host` (default) gives guest sockets real host sockets; parallel guests share the host
  port space. `--network isolated` refuses inet sockets.
* `shade boot` exits 0 on `quit`, when pid 1 exits, when `--ticks` run out; 1 on an internal error
  (failed snapshot write, gdb disconnect, scheduler stall). The guest's exit code is never the
  process exit code: parse `[process] exit pid=N status=S [signal=G]`.

## `--control-stdin` (`app/control/live_control.cpp`, `src/runtime/emulator_session.cpp`)

One command per line; `#` comments; EOF on stdin does not stop the emulator (send `quit`).
Replies are log lines starting with `[control]`. Ready marker: `[control] ready; use help for commands`.
Coordinates are UI points, portrait, origin top-left: 320x480 on iPhone/iPod, 768x1024 on iPad.

| command | reply |
|---|---|
| `tap X Y [hold-ms]` | `[control] gesture=tap scheduled events=2`, later `[transition] input-complete` |
| `drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2 [duration-ms] [steps]` | `gesture=drag scheduled` |
| `touch down/move/up/cancel X Y` | `touch queued` |
| `home` (`wake`), `lock [hold-ms]`, `unlock` (home + slide gesture of the profile) | `home requested`, `gesture=unlock scheduled events=14` |
| `button home/lock/volume-up/volume-down down/up`, `hold BUTTON MS`, `volume-up`, `volume-down`, `ringer ring/silent` | `button event queued` ... |
| `snapshot PATH` (.png/.bmp/else PPM) | `snapshot=PATH frame=N` (a failed write kills shade) |
| `snapshot-sequence PREFIX INTERVAL-MS COUNT` | one line per PPM |
| `settle` | `[transition] settle id=N`, then `[transition] internal-stable id=N` once the display content has not changed for 60 display periods of guest time, counted from the frame on screen (its `input-complete-ns` is the settle's start). Like an input, it replaces the transition being watched |
| `status` | `status frame= submitted-frame= processes= threads= runnable= active-process= display-power=on/off` |
| `ps [PID/NAME]` | `process pid= ppid= state= exit= signal= name= path=` per process, then `processes matches=N` |
| `threads PID/NAME` | pc/lr/sp, frame-pointer backtrace, wait reason per thread |
| `perf-begin LABEL` / `perf-end` | with `--perf-summary` only |
| `quit` | `quit requested` |

`ps`/`status` are the screenshot-free way to ask "is SpringBoard alive, did the app exit".
Shade itself also dumps `threads` of any process that dies on a signal.

## Other inputs and outputs

* `--touch-replay FILE`: lines `<absolute-ms-from-start> down|move|up|cancel X Y`, non-decreasing.
* `--frame-output FILE`: rewritten atomically (tmp + rename) on every submitted frame; each frame
  logs `[display] frame=N visible-pixels=P`. The display sleeps after about a minute without input
  (`visible-pixels=0`, `display-power=off`); `home` wakes it.
* `--gdb PORT`: 127.0.0.1 only, waits for the client before pid 1 runs; all processes as `pPID.TID`;
  core registers only (no VFP), software breakpoints only, dropped on exec. lldb: `gdb-remote PORT`.
* `--binary PATH` replaces launchd as pid 1; `--guest-command CMD` gives it `-c CMD`
  (so `--binary /bin/sh --guest-command '...'`, if the firmware has a shell). The run ends when pid 1 exits.
* `--ticks N`: deterministic clock, stops after N guest CPU ticks or when every thread idles.
* `--perf-summary`: one `[perf]` line with fork/exec/abnormal-exit counters at exit.

## Guest output

* A guest fd 1/2 that nobody redirected, and `/dev/console`, are copied raw into the shade log.
  launchd sends daemons' stdout to `/dev/null` unless the job has `StandardOutPath`.
* There is no host-side syslog: the guest's own syslogd/ASL write into the rootfs. The launchd
  vproc log appears as `[launchd-log] pid=1 ... message=...`.
* Emulator-detected crashes: `[cpu] fatal pid= pc= lr= fault= access= size=`, then
  `[process] exit pid= status=0 signal=11` and a `[control] thread ...` dump.

## Milestones without screenshots (what `scripts/summary.py` reads)

| milestone | line |
|---|---|
| emulator up | `[control] ready` |
| boot logo | `[display] frame=1` |
| process launched | `[process] spawn-setexec pid=N parent=1 ... PATH argv=...`, `[process] exec pid=N PATH` |
| backboardd/SpringBoard owns the display | `[display] scanout-owner pid=N` |
| data migration (iOS 6 first boot) | frames with small `visible-pixels` (logo + progress bar) |
| Setup Assistant (when not skipped) | spawn of `/Applications/Setup.app/Setup` |
| SpringBoard UI finished launching | `did-finish-launching pid=N SpringBoard` in `/private/var/charon/events.log` (charon-inject.dylib) |
| app launched / alive / crashed | `app-did-finish-launching`, `app-alive` in events.log; `[process] exit ... signal=`; `ps NAME` |
| test finished | `/private/var/charon/verdict.json` (charon-runner), `[process] exit pid=<runner>` |

## Host cache and speed

* `--host-cache DIR`: `executable-catalog.bin` (Mach-O scan keyed by absolute host path + inode,
  so a fresh clone rescans: ~5 s), `jit-artifacts.bin` (translations keyed by content SHA-256 +
  CPU model + ABI; flock-guarded; reusable across clones), `vulkan-pipeline-cache.bin`.
  Temporary file names in that directory are not unique per process, so parallel runs must not
  share one cache directory.
* `$TMPDIR/shade-shared-cache-<uid>/`: content-addressed copies of mapped guest files, designed to
  be shared by all runs.
* Guest trees must live in `*.noindex` folders: Spotlight indexing clones took ~2.5 host cores.
