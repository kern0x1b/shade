# Shade

**Charon's emulator for legacy iPhone OS and iOS userlands, on macOS arm64.**

Shade boots a firmware's own userland — launchd, the daemons, SpringBoard and the
applications — over an emulated XNU kernel, on a JIT-translated ARM CPU
([Umbra](https://github.com/kern0x1b/umbra)). It exists so that software built for
old iPhones, iPods and iPads can be started and tested on a Mac before it goes to
a real device.

## What it does

- Emulates the devices in `shade profile --list`: iPhone 2G, 3G, 3GS, 4 and 4S,
  iPod touch 1, 2 and 4, iPad and iPad 2.
- Boots real firmware root filesystems from iPhone OS 3.0 through iOS 6.1.3 in
  Charon's acceptance runs; the kernel ABIs it knows are listed by `shade abi`.
- Draws the guest's OpenGL ES on a host Vulkan driver, plays its audio, delivers
  touch and button input, and answers the guest's IOKit, Mach and BSD calls itself.
- Publishes the hardware the firmware looks for — audio, baseband, display,
  keybag — the way the real devices do; the iPhone 4S's Voice audio device is
  described from a registry dump of a real one.
- Runs a test program inside the guest and hands back its result; that is how
  [Charon](https://github.com/kern0x1b/charon)'s `xmake emulate` uses it.

## How it works

`shade boot` loads the root filesystem and starts `launchd` as the guest's first
process. The guest's CPU is translated to host code by Umbra; its system calls,
Mach messages and IOKit requests are answered by Shade's own kernel model in
`src/kernel`, `src/mach` and `src/device_state`. Frameworks the emulated hardware
would serve — graphics, audio, telephony — are answered where they cross the
boundary, in `src/graphics`, `src/media` and `src/telephony`.

## Requirements

- macOS on Apple silicon, CMake 3.24 or later, Ninja and a C++20 compiler.
- OpenSSL, libpng, libjpeg, libplist; optionally SDL2 (a window) and FFmpeg
  (compressed audio).
- A Vulkan loader and driver, and `glslc`, to draw and to build the shaders; a CPU
  driver such as SwiftShader is enough.
- A root filesystem of the firmware to run, for example one unpacked by
  Charon's `xmake firmware rootfs`.

## Build

```sh
git submodule update --init
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-D_LIBCPP_ENABLE_CXX17_REMOVED_UNARY_BINARY_FUNCTION
cmake --build build
```

Options are `SHADE_ENABLE_SDL2`, `SHADE_ENABLE_VULKAN` and `SHADE_ENABLE_IPO`; the
compiler flag is for the bundled Boost 1.71.0 with a current Apple libc++.
Through Charon the build is the `shade` package: `xmake emulate` builds and runs it.

## Usage

```sh
build/shade profile --list
build/shade boot --rootfs "$ROOTFS" --device iPhone4,1 --display headless --gles-backend software
```

`shade --help` lists every verb: `profile`, `abi`, `inspect`, `catalog`,
`firmware prepare`, `disasm`, `boot`, `smoke` and `benchmark`. `--control-stdin`
reads commands such as `status`, `threads NAME` and `snapshot PATH` from
standard input while a guest runs, and `--gdb PORT` waits for a debugger; a guest
runs slower than a device, so `--time-scale 10` makes its clocks run at a tenth of
the host's, which the guest's own watchdogs need.
