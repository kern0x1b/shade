# Guest regression tests

Small armv7 programs that run inside the emulated device and check what only a
running guest shows: signal frames and fault delivery (`signals.c`), stale
translations after images are swapped or protections change (`remap.c`,
`remap_image.c`), and code rewritten through a second view of a page or from a
signal handler (`smc.c`).
`purgable.c` sets and reads back a memory object's
purgeable state word.
`remap_task.c` remaps memory into another task.
`sysctl_hw.c` reads the hw.* processor nodes and compares the counts with `host_info`.
`coreimage.m` draws with Core Image (an EAGL context, the CPU renderer, the
default renderer), including a Gaussian blur, and reads the pixels back.
`gles2.m` makes an OpenGL ES 2 context and checks `glReadPixels`, the compile and link of guest GLSL
ES shaders (a varying the two shaders declare differently does not link), and what they draw: uniforms,
interpolated varyings, `discard`, textures, blending.
`longrun.c` stays for a given number of seconds, for looking at what the
rest of a boot does meanwhile.

Each prints one line per check and exits with the number of failures.

Sign the results (ldid -S), put them in the rootfs of the device to boot, and
run them there as the test program of a boot; the install paths `remap.c` opens
are the `-install_name` values above.
